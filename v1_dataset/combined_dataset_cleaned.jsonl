The introduction of the idea of determinism robbed people of a sense of agency, and those who couldn't just ignore it started to search out randomness as the source of their free will with stuff like the microtubule quantum theory. But randomness isn't free will, it's just randomness which is equally \"bad\" as determinism in this mindset. What you have to do is change your mindset. If you think of *yourself* as separate from the physical processes that *deterministically* compose you then yes those processes are deciding for you and therefore you have no free will. But if you identify with those deterministic processes as a part of yourself then you are the one deciding those processes, and hence you have free will.

Although I worry about how fast the field is moving vs. how slow it is to get degrees.\n- I spend a lot of my time working on cool projects that are often way too big and don't go anywhere, watching 3b1b style math videos, and watching AI videos. (Because of one of those projects I have a pretty cool dataset of game state and inputs from hundreds of thousands of matches in an online game, which is actually pretty cool since as far as I know it's a fairly unique dataset. Only thing I've used it for so far, though, is creating a leaderboard of players since the game doesn't have an official one.)\n- I have a lot of ideas that I wish I could try out but more often than not I never get the chance.\n- In an attempt to get experience that will help me get an AI research position sometime down the line I am currently doing some work making a chatbot that can retrieve data from an API to answer questions. Although it's been very difficult to do that and as many classes as I'm taking right now, since the opportunity only presented itself after semester started.\n- If anyone has any cool projects that I can be involved in, that would be super awesome, if I can help out at all!

That's what I'm doing rn and I think it's going pretty well, although to be fair I do have an undergrad degree in math so might not be a fair comparison\n\nAlso I'm always looking for help on projects \ud83d\ude42"}]}

I can respond with my thoughts since you've been asking though. I'm not an AI researcher but just got done with a period of physics research.\n\nThe Bitter Lesson comes to mind: http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html \nThe bitter lesson is that AI breakthroughs have been won by general methods trained on absurd amounts of data with a ton of computing power. So progress in large AIs seems to be to use general methods and then go back later and study what the model is doing (interpretability research). This seems really stark in everything I've studied with NLP and procedural generation of text; decades of really clever research and text and programming language systems, and the results always struck me as really janky and stuck at ~1990's text games level of quality! So when you say \"look at a piece of information and link it to its knowledge graph,\" I worry that this would be equivalent to putting in specific mechanisms by hand, which oftentimes just doesn't work!\n\nAlso, we have to worry about training complexity. It's fine if you design a model with just the right knowledge graph representation, short-term memory, long-term memory, working state, access to tools, etc. and it would be AGI if only you could find the right point in 9 billion dimensional space! But if it doesn't scale with the # of GPUs and we can't do backprop on it, then we're still dead in the water.\n\nBut I hesitated typing all of this because my interest is really in applying other people's models! Right, I think it's a safe bet that none of us in this server are going to train an AGI base model. But what we can do is be on the forefront of applications, fine-tuning, and explore capabilities of models that researchers missed!

Having just a PhD in economics and then asking said non-creative AI \"help me incorporate ideas from other domains to work into my subject area\" certainly would not go well given that GPTs are next-token-predictors meaning they will tell you ~average~ thoughts and average thoughts are by definition not creative. \n\nSo i guess you could say after some hammering out of exactly what we're talking about here then we're in agreement GIVEN THE ASSUMPTION THAT GPT-N WILL NEVER GAIN CREATIVITY"}]}

That should give an estimate as to which GPTN will reach creativity if we assume that GPTs can even do so.

It is very possible that there may be some alternative learning algorithms. I would rather it use consciousness though because the precedent for that one gives us hints as to how such an agent will think/act when it reaches higher levels (precedent being enlightened figures like buddha). that video mentions 12 levels, and the hoe math one uses 9. I would not be surprised if there were more, and AGI may be capable of reaching them more quickly than us (we take generations to unlock new ones).

The idea of government having that kind of control is terrifying. I think this makes a good case for distributed systems generally.

Bottom up is perhaps a better approach, and perhaps even practical given the CSB type systems.

I just don't think it's much of an illusion, like up and down right, good and evil aren't hard to distinguish as being entirely diametrically opposed. It's not really like the duck and rabbit scenario because the two images are mirror reflections and there's no separation between the symmetry of each side. It is either good or evil but not both, well in the non dual way you would say it is both both and neither. And neither neither nor both. Because the good evil dichotomy is one angle of a many shaped object where we could also have other characteristics like openness or honesty or charitability or whathaveyou. But by the same token what is good subtracts evil from evil, and what is evil subtracts good from good. The thing here is that you don't even have to try to see an animal in the duck rabbit picture, all you need to look for is to see life, perhaps. So in the good vs evil picture you're just seeing attribute or positivity or negativity as the characteristic.  You don't even have to look at it being a factor in virtue or in attachment or in pleasure and pain. Right? So calling it an illusion again can be countered to show that the illusion is only there when you're not looking at what's there but at what's missing. So it's missing to judge it as morality or virtue, but it's there to say it is what it is in the sense that good vs evil can be quickly simply and easily defined as some kind of battle between two opposing entities that have countering energies where one is for the benefit of the whole and the other is to it's detriment (good evil).  Similarly it's not looking at an image that can appear with different orientations as to it's relativity and coming across as two separate possible creatures, instead it's looking at something that can either be up or down, right the rotation here is perfect and whole, there's no need to add further detail to this reflexive reaction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you're getting too caught up in the incompleteness of this comparison.

And you're sitting here saying \"look! to my left there's good and to my right there's evil.

The first goal is just to see if we can create a good communication mechanism that people enjoy using\n\nMaybe with this \"reset groups every week\" idea we can actually try out different setups to see what works and what doesn't"}]}

Most of the 'value' of these interactions comes from a perceived human connection, and if bots start to be the ones responding then I'm not sure what the value actually is. Tbf I'm not super knowledgeable about YouTube as a whole, and I'd assume that this is a way to create better engagement for creators within their communities.\n\nThe main thing is that if we have online experiences where the value is supposed to be rooted in real human interaction, then it will be degraded over time, and products like these will drive up the value of real human interaction. Basically I'm skeptical that people would feel that getting a response from a bot is as cool as getting a response from a real creator, and I could see backlash.\n\nHowever at the same time these kinds of things already exist, where people can interact with AI versions of their favorite celebrities, and Meta seems to think that it's fairly valuable.

Also, fractals don't have to hold to all scales, so even on truncating (2) to a finite sum you still could have difficulties differentiating. Basically even if it is not strictly nondifferentiable, you could still have (f(x+h)-f(x))/h returns garbage data for 1e-10<h<1. This is the same reason why you can claim various real world objects are fractal despite being made of atoms, you just have some range of length scales where your system exhibits fractal structure, and you allow the fractal dimension to depend on length scale.\n\nBut IMO we should still be perfectly happy to do the experimental mathematics, \"just do it with millions of dollars of compute and see if it works,\" though. Differentiability isn't something I expect to be at the heart of why modern giant ML models are smart, but maybe that's a radical position? I dunno, I did grad school for physics not ML lol.\n\nYknow what I'm going to add something to my weekend project list: \"Experimentally run gradient descent approximations on various fractal functions like f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^(-n) cos(3^n x)\" :D"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yooooo if you run that experiment PLEASE join my discord and talk about it that'd be so hype. thanks for the amazing comment happy to have you!"}]}

I don't think it follows that one must \"surpass statistics\" to create the model. In fact, I think what has been shown is that statistics are sufficient to produce said models, just not merely 'surface' level statistics, although this terminology may be vague. \nIf we assume that this is not qualitatively different from the kind of modeling going on in the brain, it follows that the models used by the brain are similarly reducible to statistics. (However we may want to distinguishing between unconscious models like that which the cerebellum uses to help us balance and mental models like using the \"Mind Palace\" memory technique to visualize a space in one's minds eye, as I'm unsure how qualia would be reducible to statistics, or what that would even mean.)\n\nThe possible critique of this view which springs to mind is Penrose's view that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness theorems demonstrate human's ability to reason independent of any formal axiomatic system, as we are easily able to see that G\u00f6del sentences are unprovable, even if the formalism itself cannot.\nThat said, this may be possible to solve if we consider that we are able to work not merely within the space of only one formalism, but within the set of all possible formalisms and compare them with model theoretic rules of inference, like parsimoniousness and the like. Does this ability fall within the set of computable functions?

Chaos is where a system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions. That is, arbitrarily small chances in the initial state can lead to massive changes as the system moves forward in time. This is why we see the pendulum infinitely changing colour as we zoom further and further. Fractals are self recursive, very pure, mathematical objects which I think are unlikely to come up in loss landscapes. \n\nWith it in mind that we are looking for a sensitive dependence on initial conditions, it would seem to me this is indicative of a over parameterised neural network, towards the peak of the double descent test loss. I wouldn't be too surprised if chaos in loss learning has been at least alluded to in the literature and definitely its worth checking.\n\nIt worth noting, as others have pointed out, sensitive dependence deals with arbitrarily small values which is in opposition to the finite precision offered by computers, which makes an empirical study somewhat of an uphill battle.\n\nNice video! :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "haha yes certainly fantastic comment\n\nI was in fact referring to chaos, but also fractals. Believe it or not I majored in math and do (kind of) understand the difference, but you probably shouldn't believe me given how my loose use of terms is so out-of-character for such a background. The issues with my terminology you found come from a combination of 1) me being rusty on the subject, 2) me preferring to use metaphors, words that are only tangentially related, and generally loose speech as a way to foster creativity, and 3) the word fractal is more fun and makes a better YouTube thumbnail. However my reasoning here is shaky at best, so I totally do expect a rational bystander to say you made the better point\n\nLet's disagree for now about fractals showing up in loss landscapes. It's not something I'm confident in, but do have a very interesting intuition behind which I will be revealing later.\n\nAgain yes you're totally right, a legitimate scientist would be doing proper background research into chaos in the learning process before publicly making claims or sharing ideas\n\nCertainly floating points are an issue here and if I remember correctly I alluded to such in my video. Of course chaotic behavior can in fact easily be shown in far simpler computer systems such as a Lorenz system simulation, but whether the same effect would be more difficult to tease out in something with as many parameters as an LLM is a great question.

So when GPT said there wasn't any recursion, I think that isn't quite true. Because the networks are finite in size, I think the fractals will have a limit to their complexity, similar to how we commonly include an iteration cap when rendering the Mandelbrot set.

But if all you care about is that people read and cite it, as I do, then publishing to arXiv is the way to go. I read recently that somewhere between a quarter and a third of AI papers published to arXiv never get sent to an actual journal. In reality no on one in the field really waits to read journal publications months later, they just check the newest arXiv papers of the day like I do in my weekly paper summary videos. AI is moving far too fast to care about traditional peer review\n\nRather than a full review process arXiv uses what they call endorsements where certified endorsers (people who've published to arXiv multiple times and been granted the title) can skim / lightly read your article rather than actually tear it apart as a journal would do, and based on that skimming they can endorse your article for publication. All they're checking for is that your paper is on-topic for the arXiv category you've submitted, and that it's not obviously majorly flawed. If you submit something that's poorly written/formatted, completely nonsensical, totally off topic, or clearly demonstrates you're not caught up enough with forefront knowledge in the field to create anything of substance, then they'll reject. This process is much easier if you know an endorser (I happened to meet a bigwig this past summer who I'm hoping will be mine) but if not then you can request endorsement through the website by a specific researcher in your category who is listed as an endorser."}]}

That's reminiscent of what they did towards the end of this video, test to see if they could aggregate/summarize the info to be fed into the models rather than giving each model the fully detailed information.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\n\n\n\nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\n\n\n\n I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\n\n\n\nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461</a>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "love the passion! i\u2019ll download the article and maybe do a video on it. I definitely don\u2019t understand your comment or TNGS theory well enough to be sure that this is a valid critique, but there\u2019s just one thing i\u2019d like to point out. \n\nI\u2019m of Geoffrey Hinton\u2019s recently reached opinion that it\u2019s not obvious that machine intelligence will need to emulate biological intelligence in order to measure up to and surpass it. There are certainly cases of biological inspiration helping advance the field of AI, most obviously with the invention of artificial neurons, and there are likely to be more in the future. However, it may be the case that our own method of attaining intelligence/consciousness is only one route among many, and we may even find out that our own type of intelligence/consciousness is only one type among many. Gradient descent certainly does not resemble what happens in the human brain, and yet it seems to be more efficient and capable in many ways, such as sheer bulk of memorization, information density in the network, and speed of convergence (ofc it is inferior in some ways, such as inability to remember old data after a training distribution shift). \n\nThe history of science is one of humans discovering that we are less important, unique, or at the center of our universe than we thought, and we may be about to re-experience that Galileo-Copernicus revaluation in reference to the nature of intelligence and/or consciousness."}]}

Off the top of my head I think it'd be really cool to incorporate whisper for speech to text so that the Bible study groups can meet in person to do this as well. Multi-person interaction with a chatbot, maybe by creating a discord bot or something, would be great for doing this remotely. I wonder what the ideal prompt would be? Like how aware of this CSI concept should you make the model when giving it the context for the conversation? Would a simple \"Summarize this conversation\" do well, or would it make more sense to say \"[Explanation of what CSI is here] Now please summarize this dialogue in a manner that will facilitate knowledge transfer to a different group as per the goal of CSI.\""}]}

I do this rather than reading abstracts because they're frequently not very helpful. \n\nI've got a math degree and didn't need to go into detail here so there wasn't a huge need to have it explain math in this case. The problem with asking it about math in a document is that usually OCR is not good at picking up latex from PDFs, although if you want to upload individual screenshots then GPT4 with vision is reasonable at understanding what's going on there. Generally GPT is good with getting an introduction to a concept in math and pointing you in the direction of good resources. It's also pretty good at doing/teaching any math that can be written in code form, which I could've done her if I was struggling and wanted a more thorough explanation given that it's all just linear algebra. However, it's really not useful for proofs or more complicated concepts unless you've got the math background to dissect/correct what it's saying and are willing to treat it like a harsh teacher would grade a dumb student. \n\nHop on my discord if you like this stuff and would be interested in discussing more!"}]}
